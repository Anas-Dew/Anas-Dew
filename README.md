üî• I have a passion for solving problems and building products that matter. I have been coding since 2021 and have built 10+ products.

## Projects I love.

* I've made ChatGPT clone named as [CloneGPT](https://clonegpt.netlify.app/) that works as well. I made this in 4 hours and 18 minutes.

* I've built [QuickSQLconnector](http://quicksqlconnector.web.app/) which let's folks work with SQL databases with just one line of code, reducing upto 80% lines of code and lots of headache.

* I've built [Nostalgia Google](https://bye-nostalgia-google.netlify.app/) which brings you to 2002. The old style of Google. It got Viral with over 397K+ Views over the internet. [Test out](https://google2002.netlify.app/)

* [Join the Dewsverse Discord Community](https://bit.ly/dewsverse-community)

* Currently building a productivity extension named [Todo Stack](http://todostack.vercel.app/) which is the fastest todo app (probably) because it works only with your keyborad.
* ü§ù  I'm open to collaborating on a new project, writing blogs or something that interests me.

* ‚ö°  I still watch FRIENDS and The Big Bang Theory (On Reels üòÅ).

## Top Repositories
I am absolutely thrilled to share with you the amazing apps that I have created!

* [SuperURL](https://superurl.pythonanywhere.com/), It's a link shortener tool and API that also lets you secure it with password as well. [API](https://github.com/Anas-Dew/super-url/blob/main/API_Documentation.md) is available for free to use.
* [Phrase2Word](https://phrase2word.netlify.app/) is a AI tool built with OpenAI API that finds the best possible word for a specific phrase.
* [Todo Stack](https://todostack.vercel.app/) is the simplest yet most powerful todo chrome extension that is built upon the principle of the _Vim Text Editor_, which is to _don't touch the mouse_ and work with the keyboard to do things fast and efficiently.

## Few Other Projects
These are the projects which i built for fun or to learn a new concept.

* [Reddit Bot](https://github.com/Anas-Dew/Reddit-Bot). Effortlessly download the most popular videos from any subreddit you desire.
* [Frinance](https://frinance.vercel.app/) is the simplest expense tracker MERN app. It has features like filter by date and filter by category as well.
* [Project OpenAI](https://github.com/Anas-Dew/project-open-ai) is a native gui app that is written on python. It lets you use open ai through voice command. Just like Alexa.
